# nate

An experiment using randomness and natural selection to make a brain similar to our good friend Nate.

As it turns out, it will take a long time, as well as a lot more complicated math to get anywhere near what a brain does. That being said, I did manage to make a clean implementation of a basic program using a JSON config file and dependency injection to acheive a non-functional random number generator.

Even our good friend Nate is not this stupid.

I said this a long time ago in a blog post, but I'd like to get more into machine consciousness implemented in Java in the near future and more formal machine learning, instead of random number generation as I've essentially done in this project and my dabble project from last year.
